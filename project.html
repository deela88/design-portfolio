          <h1>Loom</h1>
          <p>As remote workforces gain popularity across all industries, remote workers and businesses still find it difficult to collaborate as efficiently as teams working in brick-and-mortar workspaces. Loom seeks to bridge the geographic gap between remote teams and individuals and give them the collaborative tools to create their best work. As lead designer on the project, I helped design the brand’s core identity and helped them carve out a space in the cloud storage and organization market.</p>

          <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
          <p>Our client had passion and lots of ideas, but they needed help crafting a brand identity that tapped into a specific audience and their unique needs. Because they lacked focus in this area, their product also lacked specific features and functions that would set them apart from other contenders in the market.</p>

          <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
          <p>Loom was the result of intensive user research and testing that included surveys, countless usability tests, and data collection. At its core, it is a robust cloud storage web app whose versatility allows both remote teams and individuals to make creativity and collaboration a unique experience every time. Its unique note-taking features and digital whiteboarding capabilities will let users capture and share data online with others in a way that feels tangible and real. </p>

            <h3>USER SURVEYS</h3>
            <p>We conducted user surveys to gauge what users were looking for in a cloud storage app. Most of our survey takers were young creative professionals or otherwise tech-savvy workers and students. They used cloud storage apps everyday for work, school, or personal storage of music and media. They shared files almost everyday on average and needed to be able to easily organize files and stay organized. They were often collaborating with coworkers online and needed a better way to utilize their files to work more efficiently and be more creative.</p>

They humanised our designs and kept our users at the forefront of each solution we built. Derrick represented our power user, who would utilize our Whiteboard and Note features to collaborate in real-time with his remote team. Judy was a student who would use Loom’s data organization features to keep her lecture notes and photos organized easily.</p>

              <p>I use Dropbox everyday to share files and collaborate with my remote coworkers on

  annoying to have to switch back and forth between apps, and there’s no guarantee
  I can upload directly from Dropbox into these apps to work on them. And the
  collaborative tools lack the same spontaneity and creativity we would have if we
  were colocated. Even though we’re from all over, I want to work on projects in real
  time, as if we’re all in the same room together. That’s hard with lag and
  incompatible app integration.</p>

            <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>

            <p>Using the competitor apps that our survey takers named in our user surveys, we conducted a competitive analysis to define Loom’s niche in the market. We compared <span class="emphasis">Google Drive, Dropbox,</span> and <span class="emphasis">Evernote</span>. Based on our research, we found the best way that Loom could enter the market was through a combination of strategies that helps to gain users and ultimately retain and give incentives for sharing the app with others. Requiring users to sign up for the app in order to be able to use it and also requiring their friends and colleagues to sign up for it to receive their shared files is a good strategy to keep gaining new users. Giving storage space as incentives for referrals is another way to build retention. The app itself should focus on ease of use with low barriers for entry (ie. it gets out of the user’s way and straight to business) and has great integration with major third party apps to fit easily into the user’s existing workflow. </p>

            <p>This is where we started to hone in on the functionality of Loom. User stories allowed us to prioritize the core functions of the app so that our interface had the proper hierarchy and information architecture when we started building our wireframes. Below are examples of the higher priority user tasks that defined Loom’s main functionality, along with lower priority tasks that rounded out the user experience. Fully fleshing out the high-priority tasks and maximizing their efficacy was key to staying on track.</p>

            <p>Our main focus was file organization and perfecting the uploading and sharing flow. We determined that users also needed to be able to create and share Notes. In the Whiteboard flows, it was imperative that users could communicate with their teammates and have access to whiteboarding tools no matter where they were on the infinite workspace. After defining these user tasks by priority, we used that hieararchy to structure our screens together to create a seamless, cohesive user experience in the user flows.

            <h3>WIREFRAMES</h3>
            <p>Our main focus was file organization and perfecting the uploading and sharing flow. We determined that users also needed to be able to create and share Notes. In the Whiteboard flows, it was imperative that users could communicate with their teammates and have access to whiteboarding tools no matter where they were on the infinite workspace. After defining these user tasks by priority, we used that hieararchy to structure our screens together to create a seamless, cohesive user experience in the user flows.

            <h3>USABILITY TESTING</h3>
            <p>Armed with the initial wireframes, I began to test them with my peers, guiding them through 1-2 structured tasks that were based on high-priority user stories. It was paramount to test my user flows at this lo-fi stage because high understanding and comfort with the interface at this level meant a smooth user experience throughout the later iterations of the project. It also meant that I could make changes and iterate with user feedback quickly, without marrying myself to any one concept.</p>

            <h4>USABILITY TEST FEEDBACK</h4>
            <p>Our first round desktop usability test asked one user to move a file to a new folder. One note of feedback they gave us was about the location of certain buttons on the dash. They felt that the ellipse icons which indicated 'More Options' faded into the background too much and took too long to notice. They also felt that it made the desktop far too busy. So, on the second iteration, I removed the icons from the default view and made them a hover effect only, which both made the design cleaner and presented obvious actions to the user only when they went to look for them, highlighting a clear action path for them to take. The final example is our final hifi mockup after multiple rounds of iteration.</p>

            <p>We tackled Loom’s branding through creating moodboards and brain maps. Loom evoked a sense of heritage and craftsmanship, harking back to an era where artisans worked together in communities for a single purpose. We also wanted to feel casual and fun, evoking the fast-paced work environments of our modern day offices and coworking spaces. We combined woven textures with bright but restrained color palettes to achieve this casual, modern heritage feel for the branding. In regards to typography, Roboto Slab decorated our headers and callouts with its soft but bold serifs. Open Sans laid out the meat and guts of our interface with simple rounded curves and high readability. Increasing the line spacing helped make Loom feel modern and open.</p>

            <h3>MOCKUPS</h3>
            <p>Once the basic structure of the app was finalized, it was time to rig a mockup to be able to test our hypotheses on real people. In the mockup stage, we developed our wireframes digitally with Balsamiq and used InVision to create clickable prototypes. It was here that we began to face some real challenges. As our mockups came to life, we had to revisit some of our user flows and reorganize steps and tasks to streamline our design. Where something might have made sense in the wireframe alone, once it had to be interacted with, the flow didn’t make sense or it was missing transitional pages in between. </p>

            <p>This was the hardest step. Creating the final look of our design was meticulous work, but finally validating our hypotheses about our visual design choices with actual users was even harder. Not only did we have to study how users used our app, but we had to defend our design choices time and time again as they were questioned and challenged in preference tests and usability tests. Each time, though, we arrived at better iterations that struck closer to the mark of what Loom needed to become. Our testers helped us target weak spots in our design like poor icon design or unclear information hierarchy. </p>

            <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>

            <h5>STAYING ORGANIZED</h5>
            <p>We learned that creating a comprehensive design system was integral to being able to design efficiently and quickly. This was a definite challenge. Learning to think in this highly organized manner from the get-go was very difficult, especially in the design stage when it was easy to get lost in building components and not stopping to organize layers and symbols along the way. Sketch and Figma both make it easy to make changes across artboards using symbols and styles, but they require forethought to execute well. </p>

            <h5>SEEING THE BIG PICTURE</h5>
            <p>Another challenge we found in the design stage was keeping the high-priority user stories in focus as we dove deep into the granular details of our prototypes. It was easy to fully build out low-priority tasks in abundance, but it was even easier to let complex high-priority tasks stay half-baked and underdeveloped. We found ourselves constantly reiterating in response to not only usability tests but flaws that kept arising from building our prototypes. This also goes back to staying organized; if we had stayed that way from the beginning, then reiterating would have been a much faster process. </p>

            <h3>WHAT WE ACHIEVED</h3>
            <p>Ultimately, we felt that Loom succeeded in communicating its brand identity and staying consistent design-wise across both desktop and mobile. We highlighted efficiency and ease of use as core facets of our design and we felt that was successful as well. Users in our usability tests all felt that the tasks were easy to carry out and the user interface design was intuitive. Many of their verbal thought processes boiled down to, “It makes sense that this would be here.”</p>
